# crypto-portfolio
his installs Foundry and Python dependencies together.

Your project should include:

requirements.txt (Python deps)

foundry.toml

lib/ (optional, but better if preinstalled via forge install)

src/ or contracts/ (Solidity files)

You can skip RUN forge install ... if you've already committed lib/ to your repo and use COPY instead.
